Divest DTU is a group of students (staff is welcome too) that will convince the board of DTU to stop funding fossil fuels.

In 1992, 100 Nobel laureates said "We must move away from fossil fuels". Since then the UN climate panel has said that even current fossil fuel infrastructure, without new investments, is double of what it should be. Even the International Energy Agency has said that there can be no investments in fossil fuel infrastructure from now on. And yet, in 2022 DTU is investing their money in companies that build fossil fuel infrastructure.

DTU is making these investments in our name, and while pretending to take the climate emergency seriously. Working against the will and effort of so many students and staff to decarbonise society.

Business-as-usual is now causing droughts, forest fires, deadly heat, disease spread, crop failure and war. Continuing emissions will escalate all those consequences to civilization-threatening-scale.

DTUs investments in fossil fuels are a part of exactly this business-as-usual. Obviously then, part of the drastic response required in this emergency, must be for DTU to divest from fossil fuels and fund solutions instead.
