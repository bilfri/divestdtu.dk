Dear all 

After a month of radio silence we have gotten an answer from the board! We are happy about that, and we have learned that DTU since 2019 has had guidelines that their assets should be invested in fossil free portfolios. However, as we unveiled with an access of records, the guidelines have not been 100% followed with investments in e.g. Callon Petroleum Company. For now, we hope to improve the dialogue with the board and hopefully get an official statement that DTU fully commits to a divestment.

For the sake of dialogue, we therefore postpone the planned demonstration. Instead, we invite you to meet us outside 101 this Wednesday 12:10-12:50 for a conversation about DTUs role in the fossil industry. While DTU has decided on a fossil free investment strategy, they happily accept funding from the fossil industry. The funding goes to research in extending the lifetime of oil and gas wells and in new technological solutions to recover oil from previously infeasible reservoirs. As students we are a crucial part of DTU, and we represent the institution. Therefore, our voice matters, and we believe the time has come to take a stand on the role of the university in the green transition. 

Join us if you want to listen or take part in this conversation. 

And rumour has it that there will be cakeðŸ˜Š
