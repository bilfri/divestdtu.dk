DTU is funding fossil fuels!

## We call for protest 27-04-2022 at 12:00-13:00 in front of 101 main entrance.

To the students, staff and the rest of the world; DTU pretends to fight the climate crisis, but with their investments, they fund the exact same companies that are causing the crisis.

At the protest there will be speakers, who will talk about divestment and the need for change, there will be a banner stating our demand "stop funding fossil fuels" and we will hand out flyers. We will update the event here regularly.

We want an end to the destruction of nature and communities world wide and a university we can be proud of. These investments must stop now!

In 1992, 100 Nobel laureates said "We must move away from fossil fuels". Since then the UN climate panel has said that even current fossil fuel infrastructure, without new investments, is double of what it should be. Even the International Energy Agency has said that there can be no investments in fossil fuel infrastructure from now on.
And yet, in 2022 DTU is investing their money in companies that build fossil fuel infrastructure. DTU us making these investments in our name, meanwhile pretending to take the climate emergency seriously, working against the will and effort of so many students and staff to decarbonize society.

Business-as-usual is now causing droughts, forest fires, deadly heat, disease spread, crop failure and war.
Continuing emissions will escalate all those consequences to civilization-threatening-scale.
DTU's investments in fossil fuels are a part of exactly business-as-usual. As a part of the necessary response required in this emergency must be for DTU to divest from fossil fuels and fund solutions instead.

A number of the lead universities in the world have already decided to divest from fossil fuels, including the University of Oxford, Yale University, Harvard University, University College London, Boston University and Kingâ€™s College London
